1. Clicking discover button calls OMDB function. DONE
2. OMDB function returns object, info from which should be displayed on the page (title, year, plot, poster) in generated div. DONE
3. Discover also calls youtube function. DONE
4. This function returns youtube object- including videoID DONE
5. Video ID from this function is stored in a variable that is inserted into iFrame video embed DONE
(lets start off with this a MVP)
6. Make all this information appear presentable on the page
7. Add a "to watchlist" button in div to get information saved to local storage, and to add to a separate watchlist 
8. Add a "seen" button that adds the film to a "seen" list (again saving to local storage)
(if I can do this before and during class, I'm happy)

I want to use the API to retrieve the trailers and display them in a visually appealing way, such as in a grid or a carousel.
